** GETTING STARTED GITHUB  **
*****************************

The idea is to show how to install Github in a windows machine and Getting Started.

This includes:

	How to create a new Repository
	How to clone a Repository.
	How to modify a repository, create new branches, releases, etc..
	How to visualize the files and Notebooks.
	Guidelines to create a Master copy. I mean basic structure, readme files, config files, etc..
		-> gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore 
			-> This is to ignore files that are automatically generated by the compiler but not used for other Users.

DOWNLOAD NOTEBOOKS FROM GITHUB

	When you download an ipynb file using the RAW button in GitHub it displays the text int the browser.
	This is json code and contains all of the jupyter notebook cells. You can copy this text into a file 
	and name it with the extension ipynb and it will contain the notebook when using it with Jupyter.

	This is a little clunky so another options is:

		Launch an instance of the mybinder service
		Navigate to the notebook of interest
		Right Click and select Download linked file as
		

VISUALIZE JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS ON GITHUB

	Simply change .ipynb.json to .ipynb and then sync your github repo.

	If you want open that notebook with nbviewer, click the prohibitory 
	sign at the upper right corner of your notebook on the github page and choose external view available with nbviewer.
